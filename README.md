## User Story

AS A marketing agency 
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


## Description
The objective of the project is to refactor a given code (html and CSS) for better accessibility. It ensures that people with disabilities can access this website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.

Although, accessibility is much broader topic that can include complex requirements, here as a purpose of demonstration a small list of specific criteria was given to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section above.
